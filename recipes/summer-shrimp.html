        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love to make main-dish salads in the summertime and serve them with some crusty bread and a nice glass of wine! This one is one of my favorites, featuring sweet and smoky grilled shrimp and a cilantro vinaigrette.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons smokehouse maple seasoning (such as McCormick® Grill Mates®)</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>12 ounces peeled and deveined shrimp</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine olive oil, maple seasoning, and lemon juice in a glass bowl. Add shrimp and toss to coat. Refrigerate until ready to grill.</li>
            <li>Whisk olive oil, honey, lime juice, cilantro, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Set vinaigrette aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat an indoor or outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Thread the shrimp onto skewers. Grill until shrimp turn pink and opaque, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from skewers and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place mixed greens in the bottom of a large salad bowl. Lay cucumber, corn, tomato, red onion, and avocado in sections on top of the greens. Pile the grilled shrimp in the center of the salad. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss to coat. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
